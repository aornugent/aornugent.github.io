#Abstract (ESA conference):

The degree to which exotic species dominate native habitats can vary widely across landscapes. In grasslands, exotic dominance is often linked to nutrient availability, with exotic species dominating at high nutrient sites. This pattern has been linked to functional traits: relative to native species, exotic species often possess traits associated with rapid growth which may provide a competitive advantage when resources are abundant. However, these traits may be less advantageous when resources are low or when grazing pressure is high due to a trade-off between traits that help species grow fast and those that help them defend themselves.

Using community composition data from a 5-year experiment that manipulated nutrient availability and grazing we tested three predictions: 1) exotic and native species differ in their relative abundance across the landscape, with exotic species dominating at high nutrient sites in the absence of grazing and native species dominating at low nutrient sites and in the presence of grazing; 2) exotic and native species differ in traits, with dominant exotic species possessing traits associated with rapid growth (tall growth form, high SLA) and native species possessing traits associated with defence; 3) the relative abundances of exotic and native species across the landscape can be explained by coupling these trait differences with environmental selection for particular trait combinations.


#Introduction

Plant species distributions are ultimately derived from environmental and trait interactions (see: environmental filtering). For invasion to occur, introduced species must have some configuration of traits that provide them with a fitness difference allowing them to increase from rarity. The colonisation of invasive species thus provides a useful lens to investigate trait and environmental relationships. Herein, we examine invaded Australian temperate grassy woodland communities along environmental gradients in an attempt to infer mechanistic relationships between plant traits, communities and invasive species impact.

Australian temperate grasslands have undergone significant changes since European settlement (see: Prober 2016 for in depth description), with many agricultural species introduced as part of pasture improvement practices. Compared with native species, many introduced grassland species have been selected for rapid growth and palatable leaf structures. These introduced spring annuals typically dominate at high nutrient sites (esp. nutrient enriched/fertilised sites) and are thought to exclude slower growing native perennial species by drawing down limiting resources (eg: light; Borer 2014). Conversely, native species often persist at nutrient poor sites, or under grazing pressure by native herbivores (ie: kangaroos). This follows a commonly held belief that a reduced growth rates allow for resources to be diverted to herbivore defences and stress tolerance mechanisms (Lind 2013).

This dichotomy of growth and defence closely reflects two popular hypotheses from the invasion ecology literature. The enemy release hypothesis explains the increased dominance of invasive plant species following the removal of herbivores and predators (REF). Invasive species are competitively superior within a community sharing resources, but common predators decrease growth or increase mortality, preventing the exclusion native residents. However invasive species still dominate some communities regardless of grazing pressure. The resource availability hypothesis proposes that colonization is facilitated by high resource availability, either due to high resource supply or low resource uptake by competing species (Davis 2000).

While not the first to consolidate these two hypotheses (Blumenthal, 2006) the interaction of resource availability and herbivore exclusion allow us to form some preliminary hypotheses for investigating trait/environmental relationships:

  - Exotic species typically occupy high nutrient sites.
  - Exotic species increase in abundance after herbivore exclusion.
  - Species that increase in abundance after fencing have functional traits associated with growth.
  - Species that are excluded after fencing have traits associated with defence.

# Materials and methods

## Study site

Annual vegetation surveys were undertaken in 100 5m x 5m plots at 10 sites throughout the Pinnacle Reserve, Australian Capital Terrirtory (~200ha; see: Driscoll 2016). After preliminary surveys in 2010, large scale fencing was installed around 5 of the 10 plots at each site. Additionally, one of several treatments were applied to paired plots inside and outside the fences which included: slashing and biomass removal, slashing and seeding of sterile *Cecale serale*, burning and application of sugar. Soil nutrient concentrations were measured as the average of 5 x 10cm deep cores taken within each plot in 2011 and 2015. Each treatment was designed to remove exotic species biomass or manipulate soil fertility and resurveyed in subsequent years to examine the effect on exotic species cover.

## Monitoring

These 10 sites were pseudo-randomly distributed, with the caveat that each site consisted of similar terrain and was not shaded by nearby trees. Each plot is divided into four 1m^2 quadrats, with species presences recorded in each of 9 ~33cm^2 sub-quadrats during peak biomass in late October and early November. Within each quadrat, species abundance was estimated as the percentage projective cover of species canopy, as well as an estimate of percentage cover of litter, bare ground and rock. The mean abundance is calculated as the average cover of each species between the four quadrats within a plot.

In 2015, functional trait measurement of vegetative and maximum height, vegetative width and specific leaf area were recorded on dominant species (those making up >80% of plot level species pool) in fenced and unfenced control plots.

## Data analysis

Principal component analysis of soil nutrient measurements reveal that the 10 sites are arranged along a environmental gradient of fertility, primarily differing in total and available nitrogen and phosphorous, including ammonium and nitrates.

A preliminary analysis shows that while the proportion of exotic species cover inside plots increases along this fertility gradient, there are significant differences between treated and fenced plots. By grouping plots into combinations of year, fencing and treatment, we discover a consistent increase in the proportion of exotic species at high nutrients site in fenced control plots. This pattern is absent in open control plots and plots that received all other treatments. ![Figure. 1](images/fencing_effect2011-15.png)

This result is consistent with the expected response of exotic species increasing in abundance after enemy escape, and the interaction of with fertility reinforces the idea that exotic species have high nutrient requirements associated with rapid growth.
