I've been chasing my tail on this one, thinking of ways to crystalise my thoughts into something concrete. I am hoping the act of blogging this process will break the cycle and lead to something more productive.
If nothing else, it will be good practice writing.

The first chapter of my doctoral thesis makes use of an existing and ongoing study in a grassy woodland in the Australian Capital Territory. I was lucky enough to be handed an existing experimental design and a long-term dataset to explore and extend.
While the original study sought to test the efficacy of simple manipulations with the potential to reduce exotic species cover, the resulting treatment effects provide a great framework from which to explore the community and invasion dynamics that result from enemy release.

Enemy release is a hypothesis from invasion ecology to explain the increased dominance of invasive plant species following the removal of herbivores and predators. Inavsive species are competitively superior within a community sharing resources, but common predators decrease growth or increase mortaility, preventing the exclusion native residents. 
However, a number of studies have shown that even under controlling for the effects of grazing pressure, exotic species become dominant at high nutrient sites. This is likely because introduced species have been selected for rapid growth and greater productivity than their native counterparts for pasture improvement.

While not the first to consolidate these two hypotheses (eg: Blumenthal, 2006), these interacting phenomenon provide an excellent starting point to explore community and coexistence theory.

The interaction of resource availablity and herbivore exclusion leading to increased exotic dominance mirrors the same responses expected from the growth-defence trade-off exemplified in the NutNET trials. The growth-defence trade-off places rapid growth and the ability to exploit abundant resources in direct opposition to conservative growth and the ability to tolerate the stresses of resource poor or high predation evironments.
Fundamental trade-offs are an intuitive idea that is commonly invoked when exploring competition between species and coexistence within communities: put simply, two species that share an overlapping niche are able coexist where neither are able to fully capture the common resource pool. This idea has been explored in depth by the work of Tilman (1988 onwards) and forms an integral part of modern Chessonian co-existence theory (Chesson, 2000). Should a single species not abide the same trade-off constraint as others, it will likely lead to total exclusion of all neighbouring species. 

There has been much hope that these trade-offs will manifest in plant functional traits, simplifying our job of generalising species responses to suites of trait combinations. For example, the leaf economic spectrum suggests that specific leaf area (SLA; the weight per area of a leaf) is positively correlated with photosynthetic capacity and negatively correlated with leaf lifespan. We hope to generalise this association to overall difference in plant growth rates and show how difference in growth rates are effective in predicting invasion outcomes.

To test these ideas, we compare the differences in the response of native and exotic species to nutrient availability, fencing and their associated functional traits to demonstrate the resulting competitive outcomes in relation to enemy escape.

Several preliminary hypotheses warrant examination:
- Exotic species typically occupy high nutrient sites.
- Exotic species increase in abundance after herbivore exclusion.
- Species that increase in abundance have functional traits associated with rapid growth.
- The exclusion of native species and decline in species richness at high nutrient sites after fencing is the result of asymptotic competition for light relative to soil resources.

Hierarchical Bayesian modelling lends itself to the examination of this dataset, as it is flexible enough to fully exploit the advantages of the experimental design and allows us to draw inference from different sampling methods. For brief run down of the experiment to date, 100 25m^2 plots were established at 10 sites throughout a ~200ha reserve. These 10 sites were pseuo-randomly distributed, with the caveat that each site consisited of similar terrain and was not shaded by nearby trees. Annual vegetative surveys of the hundred plots have been undertaken using two simultaneous sampling methods: each plot is divded into four 1m^2 quadrats, with species precences recorded in each of 9 ~33cm^2 sub-quadrats during peak biomass in late October and early November. Within each quadrat, species abundance was estimated as the percentage projective cover of species canopy, as well as an estimate of percentage cover of litter, bare ground and rock. The mean abundance is calculated as the average cover of each species between the four quadrats within a plot.

After preliminary surveys in 2010, large scale fencing was installed around 5 of the 10 plots at each site. Additionally, one of several treatments were applied to pair plots inside and outside the fences which included: slashing and biomass removal, slashing and seeding of sterile *Cecale serale*, burning and addition of sugar. Soil nutrient concentrations were measured as the average of 5 x 10cm deep cores taken within each plot in 2011 and 2015. Each treatment was designed to remove exotic species biomass or manipulate soil fertility and resurveyed in subsequent years to examine the effect on exotic specieis cover. In 2015, functional trait measurement of vegetative and maximum height, vegetative width and specific leaf area were recorded on dominant species (those making up >80% of plot level species pool) in fenced and unfenced control plots.

Soil nutrient measurements reveal that the 10 sites are arranged along a environmental gradient of fertility, differing in total and available nitrogen and phosphorous, including ammonium and nitrates. A preliminary analysis shows that while the proportion of exotic species cover inside plots increases along this fertility gradient, there are significant differences between treated and fenced plots. By grouping plots into combinations of year, fencing and treatment, we discover a consistent increase in the proportion of exotic species at high nutrients site in fenced control plots. This pattern is absent in open control plots and plots that recieved all other treatments.

This result is consistent with the expected response of exotic species increasing in abundance after enemy escape, and the interaction of with fertility reinforces the idea that exotic species have high nutrient requirements associated with rapid growth. Two possible explanations for this result include the preference of herbivores for exotic species (higher nutrient requirements = greater nutritional value) or an enhanced ability to exploit fertile resource pools due to growth rates greater than those of native species.

To distinguish between the two, we examine the positions of exotic species dominance along the aforementioned gradient of fertility in combination with functional trait differences between native and exotic species. The decline in species richness in fenced control plots at high fertility site is consistent with superior competitive ability of exotic species, an ability that is reflected in the predominance of exotics with traits associated with rapid growth. Above ground traits of height, vegetative cover and high SLA are associated with rapid growth where soil resources permit.
