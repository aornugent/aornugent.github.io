To test the link between competitive outcomes, growth rates and plant functional traits, I aim to establish a glasshouse competition trial between common and abundant grass species found in the Australian Capital Territory.

Using a response surface design, I will examine the effect of nutrient availablity (low, medium and high) on the competitve outcomes between exotic species and a representative native community. Germinated seedlings of equivalent size will be planted into 13cm diameter pots, 2L volume, filled with nutrient poor, sterilised riversand and vermiculite. 1/8, 1/2 and 1 strenght Hoagland soltion will be added to each pot at the beginning of the experiment, and all plots will be watered equally to prevent water limitations.

Species will be planted in monocultures at different densities, and in species mixtures of differing relative frequencies densities. Performance will be measured as the total biomass produced for each species after 12wks at the end of the trial.

We expect to see rapid growing species to have greater competitive effect where nutrients are not limiting, and where rapid growth and high SLA enable exotic species to capture a incident light to a greater degree. Where soil nutrients are limiting, we expect slower growing species to have greater performance relative to their monoculture counterparts and potentially limit the performance of their fast growing counter parts.

Again, this balance between above and below ground competition stems from both the growth defence trait and the concept of asymptotic competition.
