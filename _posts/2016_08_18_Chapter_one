I've been chasing my tail on this one, thinking of ways to crystalise my thoughts into something concrete. I am hoping the act of blogging this process will break the cycle and lead to something more produtive.
If nothing else, it will be good practice writing.

The first chapter of my doctoral thesis makes use of an existing and ongoing study in a grassy woodland in the Australian Capital Territory. I was lucky enough to be handed an existing experimental design and a long-term dataset to explore and extend.
While the original study sought to test simple manipulations with the potential to reduce exotic species cover, the resulting treatment effects provide a great framework from which to explore the community and invasion dynamics that result from enemy release.

Enemy release is hypothesis from the invasion ecology literature that is commonly invoked to explain the increased dominance of invasive plant species following the removal of herbivores and predators. This stems from the idea that inavsive species are competitively superior or experience greater fitness in a shared environment, but common predators prevent the exclusion native residents. 
However, a number of studies have shown that even under controlling for the effects of grazing pressure, exotic species tend to dominate most at high nutrient sites. This is likely because introduced species have been selected for rapid growth and greater productivity than their native counterparts for pasture improvement.

While not the first to consolidate these two hypotheses (eg: Blumenthal, 2006), these interacting phenomenon provide an excellent starting point to explore community and coexistence theory.

The interaction of resource availablity and herbivore exclusion leading to increased exotic dominance mirrors the same responses expected from the growth-defence trade-off exemplified in the NutNET trials. The growth-defence trade-off places rapid growth and the ability to exploit abundant resources in opposition to conservative growth and the ability to tolerate the stresses of resource poor or high predation evironments.
Fundamental trade-offs are an intuitive idea that is commonly invoked when exploring competition between species and coexistence of species within communities: put simply, two species may share an overlapping niche where neither are able to fully capture the common resource pool. This idea has been explored in depth by the work of Tilman (1988 onwards) and forms an integral part of modern Chessonian co-existence theory (Chesson, 2000). Should a single species not abide the same constraint as others, it will likely lead to total exclusion of all neighbouring species. 

There has been much hope that these trade-off will manifest in plant functional traits, simplifying our job of generalising species responses to suites of trait combinations. For example, the leaf economic spectrum suggests that specific leaf area (SLA; the weight per area of a leaf) is positively correlated with photosynthetic capacity and negatively correlated with leaf lifespan. We hope to generalise this association to overall difference in plant growth rates and show how difference in growth rates are effective in predicting invasion outcomes.

To test these ideas, we compare the differences between native and exotic species responses to nutrient availability, fencing and functional traits to demonstrate the resulting competitive outcomes in relation so enemy escape.

Several preliminary hypotheses warrant examination:
  Exotic species typicaly occupy high nutrient sites.
  Exotic species increase in abundance after herbivore exclusion.
  Species increase in abundance have functional traits associated with rapid growth.
  The exclusion of native species and decline in species richness at high nutrient sites after fencing is the result of asymptotic competition for light relative to soil resources.
