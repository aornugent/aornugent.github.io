I am a current PhD candidate at the Institute for Applied Ecology, University of Canberra. My project to date has focused on invasion ecology in temperate Australian grasslands, specifically how the interaction of herbivory, competition and plant functional traits lead to the impact invasive species have on resident communities and species coexistence.

My supervisors include Centenary Professor Richard Duncan (IAE, University of Canberra, AUS), Dr. Elizabeth Wandrag (IAE, University of Canberrra, AUS), Assistant Professor Jane Catford (University of Southampton, UK), Professor Don Driscoll (Deakin University, AUS) and Associate Professor Bernd Gruber (IAE, University of Canberra, AUS).
